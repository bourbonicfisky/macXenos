// Slot-allocation policy for the ZPD visibility result buffer, extracted as
// pure logic so its safety invariants are testable without a Metal device.
// MetalZPDVisibilityPool owns the actual MTLBuffer and delegates every
// index/generation decision here, so production and tests share ONE policy.
//
// Each slot is one 8-byte visibility counter at a fixed buffer offset, and
// maps to one physical query segment -- never to a guest ZPD address.
//
// The generation is the mechanism that keeps a recycled slot from delivering a
// stale sample count to whichever report owns the slot next. A resolve records
// the (index, generation) it was queued with; if the generation has moved on by
// the time that resolve drains, the pending read is dropped instead of being
// attributed to the new owner.
//
// Two invariants are deliberately stronger than the XeniOS mechanism reference
// this was adapted from, because both are cheap and both turn a silent
// free-list corruption into a no-op:
//   1. Release only acts on a slot that is currently acquired. In the reference
//      a never-acquired index still carries the initial generation, so a
//      spurious Release(index, 0) would push a duplicate onto the free list and
//      hand the same offset to two live segments.
//   2. Release with a non-current generation is rejected rather than trusted,
//      so a double release cannot re-add an index.
