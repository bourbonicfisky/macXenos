#define XENIA_GPU_METAL_METAL_FAULT_EPISODE_H_

// GPU fault EPISODE accounting, as a pure state machine so the grouping rules
// are pinned by the L0 suite instead of being validated only when a stochastic
// hardware fault happens to occur.
//
// WHY EPISODES EXIST: one GPU failure makes every in-flight submission complete
// with an error, and a revoked queue fails everything until it is recreated. So
// a session can log dozens of completion errors and many FAULTED encoder lines
// from a handful of real events. Measured on Viva Pinata (both_r1): 45
// completion-error headers across 19 swaps carried 5 FAULTED encoder lines and
// 2 queue revokes -- most plausibly ~2 episodes with a large collateral radius.
//
// Fault magnitude therefore needs FOUR counts, none of which substitutes for
// another: EPISODES, distinct failed submission serials, fault-bearing swaps,
// and FAULTED encoder lines.
//
// MEMBERSHIP RULE: an episode is keyed by the QUEUE EPOCH THE SUBMISSION WAS
// SUBMITTED UNDER -- never the epoch current when its callback is drained.
// Callbacks can arrive late, after the queue has already been revoked and
// recreated; keying on drain-time epoch would split one episode across two.
// Each submission carries its own epoch and episodes are tracked per-epoch
// concurrently.
// The ROOT is the LOWEST failed submission serial in the episode, NOT the
// first-reported one: completion callbacks may arrive out of submission order,
// so a lower serial reporting later is the truer root and revises it downward.
