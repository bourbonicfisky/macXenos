// Need-based consumer waits -- the Route A classification, as a pure value
// transform (OpenSpec optimize-need-based-consumer-waits, design D1/D1c).
//
// WHAT THIS DECIDES, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT
// ----------------------------------------------------
// `ResolvePendingProducerDependencies` historically proved producer completion
// with an UNCONDITIONAL synchronous boundary (commit + wait for everything),
// because under the pre-promotion default every pending record was untagged
// (submission 0) and a record's own tag could not describe its finality. The
// async promotion inverted that population: retirement tags are ON by default,
// so a normally-registered producer now carries a real submission tag and
// `ProducerComplete` decides it without any boundary at all.
//
// This header answers ONE question for a non-empty selected set: given the
// selected producers' tags, the completed-submission high-water mark, and the
// submission the currently-open command buffer will get, must the corridor
// commit, must it wait, and for what. It decides NOTHING about publication --
// the licence to publish stays where it already is, in the shared authority
// gate (`DecideMemexportConvergenceGate`, metal_memory_authority.h), which
// decides a TAGGED record by its tag alone and refuses an UNTAGGED one that
// carries no synchronous-boundary evidence. The design's D1a audit is what
// makes that split safe: because the gate never consults evidence for a tagged
// record, the tagged paths here need NO new evidence value, and a
// classification bug that routed an untagged record onto them would fail
// CLOSED at the gate rather than publish something unproven.
//
// It is device-free and side-effect free on purpose: the four D1 cases and
// their boundary conditions (`hw == tag`, `cur == tag`) are enumerable in an L0
// battery instead of being reachable only through a live corridor. There is no
// second, test-only copy of the rule -- production consumes exactly this
// function.
//
// FAIL-CLOSED IS THE DEFAULT, NOT A BRANCH
// -----------------------------------------
// `NeedBasedWaitDecision` default-constructs to `kFallbackUntagged`, the
// pre-feature synchronous path. Every input this header cannot decide -- an
// empty selection, any untagged record, or a tag that claims to be newer than
// the command buffer being encoded -- resolves to that same value, so the
// unreachable and the undecidable both land on the status quo rather than on
// the new path. The enumerator keeps design D1c's name because untagged IS the
// case it exists for; `NeedBasedWaitFallbackCause` says which undecidable input
// a particular request actually hit, so the anomalies never hide inside the
// expected one.
