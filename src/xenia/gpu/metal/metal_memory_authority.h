// Typed, non-owning cross-writer memory-authority decision and execution seam
// (OpenSpec implement-metal-cross-writer-memory-authority).
//
// This is the coordination contract the audit calls for: the same pending
// producer state (pending_writebacks_ / pending_memexports_) was previously
// interpreted independently by the vertex, texture, and WAIT_REG_MEM call
// sites. This header gives every promoted writer and consumer one typed
// vocabulary and one pure decision function for selective convergence.
//
// Design constraints this file honors (docs/metal_cross_writer_memory_authority
// _audit.md):
//   * Device-free and pure. No Metal, no command processor, no device handle.
//   * Non-owning. The decision functions read a SNAPSHOT of the existing
//     pending-producer records; they never store, mutate, or own them, and add
//     NO second version bitmap, address map, cache-key map, or independent
//     pending queue. SharedMemory validity and the command processor's pending
//     queues remain the sole sources of truth.
//   * Range-set aware. Consumers supply their precise GuestRangeSet (a texture's
//     disjoint base/mip extents, an aliased/multi-consumer set); the decision
//     selects ONLY intersecting producer records. Adjacent/disjoint ranges
//     choose no dependency (GuestRange treats adjacency as non-overlap).
//   * Non-authoritative execution. The RAM-writer publication and consumer
//     dependency seams below execute the existing publication/drain operations
//     for the promoted writers and consumers. They own no authority state.

// mirror, a late resolve drain writes RAM and the export's own convergence then
// copies buffer -> RAM over it, so the newest writer still wins by accident.
// When the shared buffer ALIASES guest RAM the accident stops working: the
// export already IS in RAM, the late resolve overwrites it there, and memexport
// convergence is a self-copy that has nothing left to restore. The bytes are
// gone. Ordering the writers at the destination seam is what makes the outcome
// a property of the model instead of a property of the backing.

//     cannot become a global drain of unrelated writers; and
