// In-flight CPU rewrite evidence for the Metal zero-copy shared-memory pre-gate
// (pre-gate-metal-zero-copy-shared-memory tasks 5.1-5.4, design D6).
//
// Mirroring guest RAM into a separate MTLBuffer gives the backend a snapshot: a
// CPU write lands in guest RAM and only reaches the GPU at the next upload,
// which the hazard-flush path can order against already-encoded readers.
// Aliasing removes that snapshot. A guest CPU write now changes, in place, the
// exact bytes a queued-but-unfinished GPU read is going to consume. XeniOS
// recorded that risk and did not measure it; this pre-gate measures it.
//
// The measurement rests on TWO INDEPENDENT SOURCES, because a single source
// would be recording its own opinion:
//
//   * EXECUTION  -- which submission most recently enrolled a host page as a
//                   shared-memory GPU consumer. Recorded on the GPU thread at
//                   MetalSharedMemory::RequestConsumedRange, from a provider
//                   that reports the submission currently being ENCODED.
//   * OBSERVATION -- that the guest CPU physically wrote a page, seen on the
//                   faulting guest thread at the one physical-memory
//                   invalidation entry, compared against a COMPLETED
//                   high-water mark supplied separately by the command
//                   processor.
//
// Neither source can produce an overlap alone: without a stamp every page reads
// idle, and without a callback nothing is ever compared. That is the point --
// "no overlap was reported" has to be falsifiable, and a run whose enrollment
// source is broken must not look like a clean run. `zero_submission_stamp_pages`
// exists for exactly that: a stamp of zero is the idle sentinel, so a provider
// that returns zero (the S7 tagless consumed-range provider does, on every
// default launch) would silently make every page unobservable. Counting those
// stamps means the report says so instead.
//
// Everything here is device-free, allocation-free after Initialize, and
// lock-free. The observation half runs on the FAULTING GUEST THREAD, inside the
// access-violation handler, WITH THE GLOBAL CRITICAL REGION ALREADY HELD --
// PhysicalHeap::TriggerCallbacks walks the callback list under the lock the
// fault path handed it, so the hook takes no lock of its own and must not want
// one. It may do nothing but bounded atomic work: no waiting, no logging, no
// allocation, no new lock, no call back into the command processor beyond the
// two immutable providers.
//
// That already-held lock is also the SYNCHRONIZATION EDGE for the execution
// half. Stamps are written on the GPU thread and read on the faulting guest
// thread, and relaxed atomics alone give no happens-before between them: a
// callback that begins after an enrollment could still legally read the old
// zero stamp and report a genuinely raced page as idle. So the GPU thread
// acquires that SAME lock around the stamp (see
// MetalSharedMemory::RequestConsumedRange). The order is then causal rather
// than hopeful:
//
//   * a callback already holding the lock happened BEFORE the enrollment, and
//     is entitled to see the page idle -- it observed a state that really was
//     current when it ran; and
//   * a callback that acquires the lock after the enrollment released it MUST
//     see the stamp.
//
// The faulting thread takes no new lock for this -- it already holds the only
// one involved -- so its cost is unchanged.
//
// An observer that cannot be armed is NOT a degraded mode. Aliasing removes the
// mirror's snapshot, so an unwatched alias would make "no overlap was reported"
// mean "nobody was looking", which is the absence-as-permission failure this
// whole pre-gate exists to prevent. Initialize therefore returns a verdict the
// owner is required to act on: MetalSharedMemory releases the alias candidate
// and installs the ordinary mirror instead, and the startup report says
// `observer_rejected` rather than claiming an accepted alias.
//
// This is CONSERVATIVE ENROLLMENT, not a rendered-corruption proof. A stamp is
// written at the production request seam, which is where a consumer declares it
// is about to read the range; a draw that later fails, is skipped, or never
// reaches an encoder still leaves the page stamped. So an overlap here is a
// PROMOTION STOP SIGNAL -- "a CPU write raced a page some unfinished submission
// had already claimed" -- and is deliberately not downgraded by trying to prove
// the read really happened. Over-stamping makes the signal too loud, never too
// quiet, which is the only direction a stop signal may err in.
