// now?", following the deferred ordering contract:
//
//   1. finish encoder
//   2. wait for all submitted work
//   3. pump completion actions
//   4. publish/drain memexport and render-target writebacks
//   5. clear derived cache state
//
// Steps 1-4 are preconditions for step 5 and this predicate decides which one
// is still outstanding. Releasing a resource an unfinished submission may read
// is the whole hazard, and dropping a queued writeback would discard
// guest-visible data that has not yet reached RAM -- guest RAM is the
// steady-state authority for it, so a pending producer is authoritative state,
// not derived cache content.
//
// Extracted as a device-free predicate for the same reason the ZPD admission
// decision was (metal_zpd_query_admission.h): the dangerous states -- a
// request arriving mid-encoder, arriving with submissions in flight, arriving
// with a writeback still unpublished -- are awkward to reach on a live command
// processor and trivial to enumerate as values. Production builds these inputs
// and calls this function, so a rule deleted in production fails conformance.
