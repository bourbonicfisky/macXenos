// Runtime cost vocabulary for the Metal zero-copy shared-memory pre-gate's
// group-6 live/trace evidence (tasks 6.3/6.4).
//
// The structural, device and mutation evidence is already accepted; what group
// 6 still has to answer is a COST question -- "does aliasing actually remove
// work, and at what price in ordering barriers and waits" -- and that question
// has to be answerable for the CONTROL ARMS too. Exact-off and forced-fallback
// runs install no observer and legitimately emit nothing through
// MetalZeroCopyOverlap, so if the cost numbers rode on that reporter the
// mirror-mode baseline the alias arm is compared against could never be
// measured. This vocabulary is therefore separate and backing-independent: the
// same line is emitted on every backing, and the alias/mirror verdict is one
// FIELD of it rather than its precondition.
//
// Three properties are load-bearing:
//
//   * EVENTS ARE COUNTED AT THE OPERATION THAT PRODUCES THEM. A commit is
//     counted at the commit, a wait that actually blocked at the block, a
//     memexport retirement at the retirement, bytes at the copy that moved
//     them. Nothing is derived from the backing mode, and nothing is derived
//     from a CONSULTATION: the ordering barrier counter advances only where a
//     predecessor drain really ran, not wherever the pending-producer snapshot
//     was read. A number inferred from configuration would restate the
//     configuration.
//
//   * COUNTERS SATURATE. These run for a whole session and are read as
//     evidence; a wrapped total would read as a small number, i.e. as "almost
//     no work happened", which is precisely the claim under test. Saturation
//     reuses ZeroCopySaturatingAdd from the overlap header rather than
//     restating it.
//
//   * DEFAULT OFF, AND OFF MEANS INERT. The meter refuses to advance until it
//     is enabled, so an unset run is silent BY STRUCTURE rather than by a
//     caller remembering not to print. Nothing here allocates, waits, logs, or
//     calls back into the backend, so the sites that count are free to sit on
//     the GPU thread's hot path; none of them sits on the faulting guest
//     thread, which may not log at all (see metal_zero_copy_overlap.h).
//
// This reporter is EVIDENCE, never a gate: no promotion decision reads it, and
// nothing in the rendering or authority path branches on it.

// The exact-off diagnostic gate for the runtime cost line.

// Exact opt-in, deliberately the SAME pure rule the alias gate parses with
// (metal_zero_copy_contract.h) rather than a second, subtly different one: two
// spellings of "is this enabled" is how a control arm ends up silently running
// with diagnostics the other arm does not have. nullptr (unset), "", "0",
// "01", " 1", "1\n" and "true" are all off.

// One counter per PRODUCTION OPERATION the cost question is asked about.
//
// Upload bytes (copied vs alias-skipped) and every overlap-observer number are
// deliberately NOT here: they are already recorded at their own operations by
// MetalSharedMemory and ZeroCopyOverlapObserver, and the reporter reads those
// existing snapshots. Duplicating them would create a second source that could
// disagree with the first.
enum class ZeroCopyCostCounter : uint32_t {
  // Frame/submission command-buffer commits. Auxiliary one-off command buffers
  // (readbacks, blits, present conversion) are NOT counted here -- they mint no
  // submission and are not part of the submission cadence this measures.
  kSubmissionCommits,
  // Commits that were followed by an explicit synchronous wait on that same
  // command buffer (the default XE_METAL_SYNC_WAIT path). Separate from the
  // commit count because a commit that returns immediately and a commit that
  // stalls the GPU thread are different costs wearing one name.
  kSyncCommitWaits,
  // Every WaitForSubmission call, including the ones satisfied by the
  // already-completed fast path...
  kWaitForSubmissionCalls,
  // ...and, separately, the ones that actually reached the condition variable.
  // Reporting only the call count would make a cheap already-done check look
  // like a stall; reporting only the blocked count would hide how often the
  // path is taken at all.
  //
  // "Reached the condition variable" is a PROVEN fact at the production site,
  // not an approximation of one: the waiter re-checks completion while holding
  // the same mutex the completion publisher advances the high-water under, and
  // holds it through the wait's first predicate evaluation. Without that shared
  // boundary the publisher could overtake the re-check and the wait would be
  // counted as blocked while never waiting -- an ATTEMPTED wait reported as a
  // stall, which the census rules forbid. What the counter does not claim is
  // duration: a wait entered and satisfied microseconds later is one block.
  kWaitForSubmissionBlocked,
  // Waits that expired instead of being satisfied. Counted apart from blocked
  // waits because a timeout is a wedged GPU, not a slow one, and a run
  // containing any is not a run whose cost numbers describe healthy work.
  kWaitForSubmissionTimeouts,
  // Memexport destination preparations attempted (one per producer draw that
  // reached the ordered-preparation seam). The fast-path and barrier counters
  // below are disjoint subsets of this, and their sum is a LOWER bound rather
  // than an identity: a draw that produced no normalizable destination range
  // never reaches an ordering verdict at all, so it is counted here and among
  // the failures and in neither of the two.
  kMemexportDestinationPreparations,
  // Preparations whose pending-producer snapshot selected nothing, so the store
  // was already last and the preparation cost no barrier at all. This is the
  // path aliasing is expected to leave alone; separating it is what keeps the
  // barrier count below from absorbing the cheap case.
  kMemexportNoOlderFastPaths,
  // Preparations where an ordering barrier REALLY RAN -- older overlapping
  // producers were selected and the drain (commit + wait + convergence) was
  // executed. Counted where the drain is invoked, never where the snapshot is
  // consulted.
  kMemexportOrderingBarriers,
  // Older overlapping producer records selected by those barriers. The barrier
  // count says how often the backend stopped; this says how much it had to
  // retire.
  kMemexportSelectedPredecessors,
  // Barriers that ended with at least one predecessor STILL PENDING. A short
  // drain retains the destination rather than being rounded up to success, so
  // this is a correctness-relevant outcome and not a cost footnote.
  kMemexportOrderingRetained,
  // Preparations that did not end prepared, for any reason (unordered, or a
  // destination range request that failed). Includes the retained outcomes
  // above, which are also counted on their own so the two causes stay
  // distinguishable.
  kMemexportPreparationFailures,
  // Pending memexport records actually retired by convergence. Counted at the
  // retirement itself and INDEPENDENTLY of the byte counter below: an aliased
  // backing retires the same records having moved zero bytes, and a record that
  // was retained (short drain, unproven finality, failed copy) never reaches
  // the retirement site at all.
  kMemexportRetirements,
  // Bytes memexport convergence PHYSICALLY copied, summed from the shared
  // memory's own factual outcome. Zero on the proven-alias path.
  kMemexportConvergenceBytesCopied,
  // Not a value: one past the last real enumerator. Every enumerator must be
  // declared ABOVE this line so the count below, and the conformance arrays
  // pinned to it, follow the enum automatically.
